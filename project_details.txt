In a bustling world where technology bridges gaps and brings people closer, imagine a tool that empowers communication in one of the richest and most beautiful languages—Bangla. Many people often type in Banglish (a mixture of Bengali written using the English alphabet) due to convenience or habit. There is a growing need for seamless and accurate conversion of Banglish to Bangla, especially for content creation, learning, and cultural preservation. Your task is to build an innovative Banglish to Bangla Conversion App that enhances the user experience with advanced features like chatbots, translation systems, and continuous learning capabilities. This app will redefine how users interact with their language, bridging the gap between convenience and authenticity.

### **Scenario**
**Rina**, a high school teacher in Dhaka, loves writing stories for her students. She often types in Banglish because it’s faster for her but struggles with accurate conversion into Bangla.

Rina dreams of an app that can:
1. Understand her Banglish inputs.
2. Translate them into beautiful Bangla.
3. Save her stories as PDFs for sharing.

Her students envision a chatbot that:
1. Can answer queries in Bangla, whether they type in Banglish or Bangla.
2. Evolves over time, learning from user inputs and becoming smarter.

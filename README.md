# 🌸 বাংলিশ (Banglish) to বাংলা (Bangla) Transformer
> *Where Technology Meets Tradition*

---

## 📖 The Story of Our Journey

In the heart of Bangladesh, where ancient scripts meet modern keystrokes, we crafted a bridge between convenience and heritage. Our application isn't just a translator; it's a cultural preservation tool, a teacher's companion, and a student's guide all woven into one digital tapestry.

### 🎯 The Vision
*Inspired by Rina's Story*

```
In a classroom in Dhaka, a teacher types her stories,
Her fingers dancing between two worlds:
The convenience of English keys,
And the beauty of Bangla expression.
```

## 🛠️ Architecture: The Two Pillars

### 1. The Soul: ML Translation Engine

Our translation engine stands on the shoulders of giants:

```python
# The Heart of Our System
model_name = "facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt"
# A bridge between worlds, one token at a time
```

**Key Components:**
- 🤓 mBART Architecture
  - Base: `mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt`
  - Specialization: Banglish → Bangla translation

**The Data Journey:**
```
Banglish Input → Tokenization → Neural Magic → Bengali Beauty
```
